Few days ago I tried to make a chat web app with socket.io I also used p5.js even it was not necessary for this project I just use it to have some practice with p5.js.

It has function which shows who is typing at the moment.I hope someone contribute it and make it much better by that way I can learn much more.I think as beginner in this field I did my best :).
I will try to make code **readable** as much as possible you also can give me a hand and give some advice to make my code more **readable**.
