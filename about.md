Born in 1995 in Kurdish city of [Nîsebîn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusaybin).I am a medical doctor who is interested in all sciences of nature (Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematic) and trying to learn programing I select javascript as a language to improve my programing skills there are many reasons why I choose javascript but main reason is it is language of web and it is all around web and one of the most popular programing language so you don't have to download anything (I assume you have a web browser installed on your computer. Probably you do.).Next language that I am  planning to learn is python which is also a popular programing language. I read some opinions about python on internet most of people recommend it because it is an easy to learn and so powerful programing language. I will give it a try.
Lets talk a little bit about what will be the topics that I am going to write about them in my blog. First of all I should tell you that English is not my native language (actually one of reasons I am blogging is to improve my English) so probably my sentences sometimes(or most of times) may sound primitive but I will continue writing(sorry!).Topics of my blog probably will be diverse but mainly I am going to write about medicine and programing I may sometimes write about my personal life.
That is it for now I hope we will have nice time together!
Take care!
